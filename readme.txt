Skype Master is the Skype supreme plugin for any Wordpress powered website. Includes Show Online Status Button.


== Description ==

Now that Microsoft bought skype and officially phased out live messenger, it was time to launch the ultimate skype communication tool for your wordpress. Skype Master allows you to display your Skype Online Status Button plus all 6 available skype actions, Call Me, Add Me, Chat with Me, View My Profile, Leave me Voicemail, Send Me a File.

Hold on, you don't need to show them all in the frontend, you can select each individual action to display in the front end. We packed this extension with the 2 famous skype colors (green or blue) to better suit your template also, we added horizontal and vertical display option to better fit your intentions and widget position.

The horizontal position works great even inside your pages and posts with our shotcode framework. Read more below and check screenshots page.
